# Customer Support Ticket Management System 

## Project Overview
The Customer Support Ticket Management System is a Salesforce-based application designed to manage customer support requests efficiently. It enables organizations to track customer issues, automate ticket assignments, and ensure timely resolution through structured workflows and real-time reporting.

## Problem Statement
Many organizations face challenges in handling customer support requests due to the lack of a centralized system. Customers struggle to track the status of their issues, while support teams manually assign tickets, follow up on cases, and maintain records. Managers have limited visibility into unresolved tickets and agent performance, leading to delays, poor customer satisfaction, and inefficient service operations.

## Proposed Salesforce Solution
• **Ticket Creation:** Customers or support agents can create support tickets with issue type, priority, and description directly in Salesforce.  
• **Automated Ticket Assignment:** Tickets are automatically assigned to support agents based on priority or category.  
• **Status Tracking:** Ticket status is updated throughout the lifecycle (New, In Progress, Resolved, Closed).  
• **Approval & Escalation:** High-priority tickets can be escalated to senior support or managers.  
• **Dashboards & Reports:** Managers gain insights into:
  - Open and closed tickets  
  - Ticket resolution time  
  - Agent-wise performance  
  - Priority-wise ticket distribution  

## Key Features & Benefits
• **Improved Efficiency:** Reduces manual ticket handling and follow-ups  
• **Transparency:** Customers and agents can track ticket status in real time  
• **Faster Resolution:** Automated routing and escalation improve response time  
• **Better Insights:** Reports and dashboards support data-driven decisions  
• **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:** Streamlined support process improves service quality
